### Build process

Every puzzle is a CMake target named using the following form: `day01_1` (puzzle day 1, part 1)
The script `build.sh` takes care of the building process. To build a target:

**Release configuration**  
`./build.sh REL` or `./build.sh REL <TARGET>`

To run the built target, `./build/release/bin/day01_1`

**Debug configuration**  
`./build.sh DBG` or `./build.sh DBG <TARGET>`

The debug configuration is configured to facilitate Visual Studio Code debugging. After breakpoints are set, press `F5` to build and debug interactively the source file currently opened 

#### Requirements

CMake ‚â• 3.15, gcc ‚â• 9.3
